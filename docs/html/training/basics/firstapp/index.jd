<p>Welcome to Android application development!</p> 

<p>This class teaches you how to build your first Android app. You’ll learn how to create an Android
project and run a debuggable version of the app. You'll also learn some fundamentals of Android app
design, including how to build a simple user interface and handle user input.</p>

<p>Before you start this class, be sure that you have your development environment set up. You need
to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the Android SDK Starter Package.</li>
  <li>Install the ADT plugin for Eclipse (if you’ll use the Eclipse IDE).</li>
  <li>Download the latest SDK tools and platforms using the SDK Manager.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you haven't already done this setup, read <a href="{@docRoot}sdk/installing/index.html">Installing
the SDK</a>. Once you've finished the setup, you're ready to begin this class.</p>

<p>This class uses a tutorial format that incrementally builds a small Android app in order to teach
you some fundamental concepts about Android development, so it's important that you follow each
step.</p>
